## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It can be really difficult to use the same image for the header and the main section. 

### Continued development

I'm still working on learning how to properly use Sass, hopefully that will make the css sheets a biit shorter.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries for Standard Devices ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) - This helped me with setting the media queries sizes.
